# Brightness controller for Linux

Works on my Dell XPS 13 by fiddling with /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight

    $ make
    $
    $ brightness +
    $ brightness -
    $ brightness 45

Replaces xbacklight, which fails in some mysterious ways for me.


    $ xbacklight -set 20
    No outputs have backlight property
