# ESP Home

## Setup

Run with docker compose or local install

```sh
$ docker compose up
$ uv run esphome dashboard ./config
```

Use web UI to configure stuff up and see logs

## Notes

1. TODO: Temp isn't calibrated right with scd30, its always a bit more than the
real value.

2. Since pi.hole isn't the DHCP server on home network, force allocate a static
IP with the DHCP server and add hardcoded DNS A records in pi.hole. Prometheus
needs a good old A record while some other apps use mDNS.

| Device        | Mac                   | IP Address        |
|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------|
| devkit.local  | `AC:67:B2:CC:9D:BC`   | `192.168.1.150`   |
| feather.local | `7C:87:CE:F7:F0:24`   | `192.168.1.151`   |

3. As of 2025.4.06, feather.local can't read from the PM sensor :/ &
   Metric `esphome_sensor_failed` is active.
